# Filing-in-C
This repository is all about file handling in C language, a little bit different than the filing in C++

Write a code in C which performs the following functions:

**Tasks:**

1) Reads the text file Input_File.txt and displays its data.

2) Write only the integers from the Input_File.txt file to another file which will be created at runtime.

3) Write non-alphabet words (non-alphabet word is the one in which all letters are non-alphabet e.g., “bc#$%#456#” is not an alphabet word but “$%^&amp;#32” is a non-alphabet word) from the Input_File.txt file into another text file which will be created at run-time.

4) Invert all the words in Input_File.txt file which contain one or more vowels and write the complete content (with inverted and non-inverted words) into another file which will be created at run time. For example ‘computer’ will be inverted to ‘retupmoc’.
